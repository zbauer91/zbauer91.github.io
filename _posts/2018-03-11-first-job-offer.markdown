I didn't think too much about it before coming to GA, but it is super important to make sure you have your priorities aligned before you start applying to jobs, _especially_ in a new location.

### My First Offer

It came as a huge surprise to be to receive an offer in the manner I did. I only had the initial screening, the technical screening, and one interview. I even met with the CTO and CEO the same day I had my in-person interview. I was a little worried about whe speed at which everything took place, so I spent a lot of time analyzing the position to see if it would be a good fit for me.

### What I Found Out

I had about three days to decide to take the offer, so In that time, I spent a lot off effort analyzing three key fields:

1. Company culture
2. Location
3. Opportunity

This list is very subjective and specific to me, but I think all three are valid areas of concern when applying for a job. Your mileage may vary.

#### Company Culture

###### What I wanted
I need a business I'm excited about working for. When I walk in your front door, I want to see smiling faces, enthusiasm in their work, and a passion when they talk about what they do to people they've never met. Some may call this an aspect of startup culture, but I don't think this needs to be relegated solely to tiny businesses with inflated aspirations. Every business can and should be a place that their employees look forward to spending their time at every day. If you can't meet this basic need, it makes getting up in the morning a chore. 

###### What I got
The three people I interviewed with didn't seem all to enthusiastic about discussing work. They talked extensively with my about my background and did a short coding challenge to show I could work with loops and recursion. They told me about their long commutes and how it's getting more expensive to live in Reston. Overall, the entire experience was underwhelming. 

One huge red flag I got was when clearing up a few questions on the phone. I specifically asked about the apparent lack of enthusiasm, and was told about the people I interviewed with that "their enthusiasm might not show on their faces, but it show in the work they do." That's a no-go for me. I've never been passionate about a single thing in my life and not have it show on my face.


#### Location

###### What I wanted
I wanted a place that would allow me the freedom to see friends regularly, bike-commute to work, and even be able to walk around and do literally anything without worrying about driving and parking. I wanted to attend meetups and have a variety of networking events and personal events to choose from. I wanted to live in a place where I could find like-minded people to share in my experiences with. in short, I wanted a big city: Any big city.  


###### What I got
This is something I didn't think through thoroughly before moving to DC. Before coming here, I would have said location wasn't a huge deal, but once I found out just how a city like Reston is lacking in so many areas, I realized location wasn't just about distance, but about personal and professional opportunity

Distance from DC aside, Reston was a bad place for me for a lot of reasons. For one, it's pretty much the suburbs. Pretentious, stone-facade town centers, nothing is walkable, biking is difficult, winding roads that don't follow a pattern, golf courses, lakes, etc. I don't like most of these things. I've lived in areas like this all of my life, and have relished living in a big city for the first time. Why would I give that up for a middle-of-the-road salary and maybe saving a little bit on housing?

Now, don't me wrong, it's not _just_ DC that I like, it's any sizeable city that meets the above criteria. I used to think I loved Pittsburgh, and that living right on the edge of town would be acceptable. Even there I found that I was unsatisfied with how I couldn't walk out my door and do stuff. I wouldn't even bike anywhere because the city is so fragmented with respect to bike lanes and bike friendly roads. 

#### Opportunity

###### What I wanted 
This one is a little more abstract to define outside of location. What I want is an opportunity to always learn new things in a way that contributes both to the team and to furthering my career. I want some sort of upward mobility as well, and don't want to be stuck at a particular _level_ for the rest of my career. I want telecommuting to be an option for down the line, and for businesses to be trusting of their employees in that regard. I tend to lump all of these things into _opportunity_.

###### What I got

Honestly, I pretty much got the whole package with this company. THey were small, so I likely wouldn't have _climbed the corporate ladder_ in any way, but the job would have been challenging. I would have been exposed to new technologies fairly regularly, and would have had to learn a lot of existing technologies just to do the job.

### Spoiler: I didn't take it

I was worried for the entire three days about whether I should take this job and just tough it out until something better came along, or if I should have taken it and be happy with their offer. Eventually, I concluded that worrying so much about a job is probably another red flag for me. 

I'm lucky too, I'm still actively interviewing, and so I don't have to take the first job that comes along. I have time to figure these sort of things out and better define what's actually important to me. I know I'll find something that fits, especially in a big place like DC
