I recently decided to try and migrate my Google information between accounts. That's what I noticed that I have over 50,000 emails

### The Problem

Ok, so if you're like me, then at some point in your life you created an email that read something like CrazySurfer89@gmail.com (<--not my email). Unfortunately, if you're also like me, you didn't plan ahead before integrating your life into the google ecosphere with that address. So now your main inbox is there, your maps history is there, contacts, project fi, etc. You see the conundrum.

So now I have a new email, zbauer91@gmail.com (<--definitely my email), and I want to migrate things over. Much easier said than done. I'll keep the scope to GMail for this post and come back to a few others later.

### The Tool

I found a tool called [Got-Your-Back](https://github.com/jay0lee/got-your-back). I owe this person some whisky for having thought of this. 

The backup was simple enough. Authorize your account to hit the Gmail API, start the tool in the terminal, and bam. done. Now you just authorize the new account to receive emails, and let it run....for hours....mine took approximately six hours to put everything back in place.

This is when I realized I have a slight hoarding problem. I backed up over 50,000 emails, and I was now paying the price for it. I had no reason to keep that many emails sitting around by any stretch of the imagination. Something needed to change.

### The Solution

I decided to try out some email clients. I've previously used Newtown, and it is an exceptional client, but it's too feature rich and has a price tag to match. I'm not handling thousands of emails and don't need that kind of productivity

I also tried thunderbird, but the dated UI and the overwhelming configuration options made it difficult to like. 

I settled on Airmail, the current reigning champ of Mac email clients. It's only mildly expensive and has enough features and integrations to make me happy.

Here's to getting below 5k saved emails!


Update 3-16-18: I got it below 1,000! Woo!
