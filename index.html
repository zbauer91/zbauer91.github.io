                <h4>About Me</h4>
                <p>I am a novice programmer expanding my career opportunities by engaging in the Web Development Immersive at
                    General Assembly in Washington, D.C. I am someone who consistently delivers great product, and who finds
                    creative, resourceful ways to solve new problems. I am empowered to find results, and know who and when
                    to ask for help.
                </p>

                <h4>Experience</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I have prior experience in Python, Java, MIPS Assembly</li>
                    <li>The General Assembly curiculum includes training in HTML, CSS, javaScript, Ruby on Rails, project planning,
                        and various common frameworks</li>
                    <li>B.S. in Biology from Penn State with a year of academic research experience, and a year of SOP regulated
                        laboratory experience. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>I am an overachiever and enjoy going above and beyond on the tasks assigned to me. I take a lot of pride
                    in the work I do, and make sure that everything I deliver is of a high quality. With these traits, I
                    want to work at a company that does the same. I want to work with people that love what they do, and
                    enjoy the people they work with. Upon completion of this program, and with my new skills, I intend to
                    find a fulfilling career in a field I love.</p>
